# A-Comparative-Study-of-Student-Success-and-Retention-Rates-in-Pursuing-Higher-Education
With the educators, institutions, and policymak
ers pushing towards better-skilled graduates, understanding the
 cause and effects of the existing education system is necessary. So
 is studying the impact it has made on students. So, as a conscious
 group of individuals, we will be studying the student success
 rates in their pursuit of higher education. This research project
 aims to enhance student success and retention by analyzing
 factors influencing dropout rates in diverse academic disciplines.
 Leveraging a comprehensive dataset encompassing demographic,
 socio-economic, and academic performance data, we seek to
 uncover the motivations driving students to persist or discontinue
 their educational pursuits. Our insights will enable institutions
 to implement targeted interventions and support mechanisms to
 enhance student retention and academic achievement.
